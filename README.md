Student Performance Detection
This is an end-to-end machine learning project aimed at detecting the student performance based on various variables such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and test preparation course. The goal is to analyze how these factors affect students' test scores.

Problem Statement
The main objective of this project is to understand the relationship between student performance and various factors that may influence it. By utilizing machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict a student's performance based on the given variables.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about students, including their test scores and several independent variables. The dataset may include the following columns:

Gender: The gender of the student (e.g., Male or Female).
Ethnicity: The ethnicity of the student (e.g., African American, Asian, Caucasian, etc.).
Parental level of education: The educational level of the student's parents (e.g., some high school, associate's degree, bachelor's degree, etc.).
Lunch: Whether the student receives a standard or free/reduced lunch.
Test preparation course: Whether the student completed a test preparation course.
Math score: The score obtained by the student in the math test.
Reading score: The score obtained by the student in the reading test.
Writing score: The score obtained by the student in the writing test.
The dataset will be divided into training and testing sets, allowing us to train the machine learning model on a subset of the data and evaluate its performance on unseen data.
